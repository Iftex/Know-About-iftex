## ðŸ§­ About Me
Hey there! I am Iftex or Iftekhar whatever you call me, an innovative and passionate developer working on both front-end and back-end technologies. Welcome to my profile â€” this is where you can know a bit about my journey, skills, current projects, work interests, worksapces, changelog of projects, new releases and other relevant things. Iâ€™m passionate about creating useful and visually appealing digital things those are not only highly functional but also user friendly. 

I was mainly focused with the front-end technologies and web developing but along the way started more things such as working with artificial intelligence, back-end projects on different languages, also have experienced versatile skills in different platfroms like Git, Github, Gitlab etc. I started my developer journey from a very young age and have gained little to larger experiences since then. I always wanted myself to take in challenges to step into bigger oppurtunities.
